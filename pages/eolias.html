        The Aeolian or Wind Islands (Italian: Isole Eolie)constitute a volcanic archipelago in the Tirreno Sea,near the northeast coast of Sicily. They were declared a World Heritage Site by Unesco in 2000.1​

The largest island is Lípari,which is why the archipelago is also known as the Livari Islands. The other islands are Vulcan, Salina, Stromboli, Filicudi, Alicudi and Panarea.

The Aeolians are arranged in the form of Y: Vulcan is located in the lower extremity, Alicudi and Stromboli at the upper ends, to the west and east respectively.

The largest city in them is Lípari, located on the island of the same name. It is home to around 11,000 inhabitants.
