        The Faroe Islands or Faroe Islands2(In Faroese: F-royar,in Danish, F-r-erne,which means "islands of lambs") are a small archipelago in the North Atlantic,between the United Kingdom, Norway and Iceland. These islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark,but do not belong to the European Union. They have an area of 1393 km21and just under 50,000 inhabitants, of whom about 20,000 live in the capital TÃ³rshavn and its conurban area.

        The Faroese archipelago consists of 18 islands of volcanic origin, of which 17 are inhabited. Its territory is predominantly mountainous, with cliffs that serve as habitat for tens of thousands of seabirds. It is dominated by meadows and lacks forests. The climate is cold, although moderated by the Gulf Stream. There are sufficient water resources, but in general the soil is poor and natural resources scarce. The economy is fundamentally dependent on fishing and its spin-off industry. However, Faroese society has a fairly high welfare status and development rate.
        
        The archipelago was colonized around the 10th century by Nordic emigrants, although there are indications of previous settlements of populations of Celtic origin. It was part of the Norwegian crown and from the sixteenth century the territory was ruled from Copenhagen.
        
        Since 1948,the Faroe Islands have their own prime minister and parliament and send two representatives to the Danish parliament. They are currently self-governmented in almost every respect except defence, foreign relations, legal system and foreign exchange policy. The Faroese have a great sense of national identity, with their own Nordic culture, their national language and even their official Church. However, positions on the status of its relationship with Denmark are between full independence and the maintenance of autonomy within the Danish State.
