        The Cíes Islands are a natural paradise in the Vigo’s estuary that forms an impressive Marine-Terrestrial Natural Park. This archipelago consists of three islands: North or Monteagudo island, Middle or do Faro island and South or San Martiño island. The first two are joined by the beach Playa de Rodas and a natural breakwater. The islands were declared a Natural Park in 1980 and included in the Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park created in 2002.
        
        The Cíes Islands promise visitors an excellent tour in a highly protected area for a maximum enjoyment of nature. Surely this has to do with the Playa de Rodas having been awarded the title of “The Best Beach in the World” by the renowned British newspaper “The Guardian”.
        
        It is worth to come and tour the islands, visit the beaches and enjoy nature in one of the few wild havens remaining on earth.
