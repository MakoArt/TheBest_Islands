The Cook Islandsmake upan archipelago located inthe South Pacific Ocean, between Hawaii and New Zealand. They have a democratic system of government-parliamentarian in free association with New Zealand. The fifteen small islands have a combined area of 236 km2,1but the Exclusive Economic Zone occupies more than 1,800,000 square kilometers of ocean.2​

The population is concentrated on the island of Rarotonga (14,153 inhabitants in 2006), where the international airport is located. There are also many cook Islanders living in New Zealand, particularly on the North Island. At the 2006 census, there were 58,008 people identified as descendants of the Maori of the Cook Islands.3​

With more than 90,000 visitors a year in 2006, tourism is the island's main source of income, above the bank, pearl and export business of seafood and exotic fruits.4​

Defence and external representation are the responsibility of New Zealand,which must also consult the Cook Islands. Even so in recent years, the Cook Islands have been adopting increasing independence in foreign affairs management. [citation required] The citizens of the Cook Islands have New Zealand citizenship and also the nationality of the Cook Islands.

The capital is Avarua. A popular art form on the islands is the tivaevae,handmade duvets.Islas Cook

The Cook Islandsmake upan archipelago located inthe South Pacific Ocean, between Hawaii and New Zealand. They have a democratic system of government-parliamentarian in free association with New Zealand. The fifteen small islands have a combined area of 236 km2,1but the Exclusive Economic Zone occupies more than 1,800,000 square kilometers of ocean.2​

The population is concentrated on the island of Rarotonga (14,153 inhabitants in 2006), where the international airport is located. There are also many cook Islanders living in New Zealand, particularly on the North Island. At the 2006 census, there were 58,008 people identified as descendants of the Maori of the Cook Islands.3​

With more than 90,000 visitors a year in 2006, tourism is the island's main source of income, above the bank, pearl and export business of seafood and exotic fruits.4​

Defence and external representation are the responsibility of New Zealand,which must also consult the Cook Islands. Even so in recent years, the Cook Islands have been adopting increasing independence in foreign affairs management. [citation required] The citizens of the Cook Islands have New Zealand citizenship and also the nationality of the Cook Islands.

The capital is Avarua. A popular art form on the islands is the tivaevae,handmade duvets.Islas Cook
