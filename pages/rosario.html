        The Islas del Rosario (Rosario Islands), also referred to as Corales Islas del Rosario (Coral Islands of Rosario),[1] is an archipelago located off the coast of Colombia, approximately 100 kilometres (62 miles) from Cartagena. [2] It is one of the 46 Natural National Parks of Colombia. The national park was founded in 1988,[1] to protect one of the most important coral reefs of the Colombian Caribbean coast. People can visit the national park area of the islands, and tours are available. [3] Isla Rosario has an aquarium and open-sea oceanarium (oceanario) that people can visit. [4][5] Activities include swimming, snorkeling[6] and fishing, among others.
