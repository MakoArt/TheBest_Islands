        Rab (Latin: Arba, Italian: Arbe, German: Arbey) is an island in Croatia located just off the northern Croatian coast in the Adriatic Sea.

        The island is 22 km (14 mi) long, has an area of 93.6 km2 (36 sq mi)[1] and 9,328 inhabitants (2011).[2] The main settlement on the island is the eponymous town of Rab, although the neighboring village of Palit has the biggest population. The highest peak is Kamenjak at 408 m. The northeastern side of the island is mostly barren, karst, while the southwestern side is covered by one of the last oak forests of the Mediterranean.
        
        Ferries connect the island of Rab with the mainland port of Stinica and with the neighbouring islands of Krk and Pag. European Coastal Airlines offered multiple daily connections by seaplane from Rab to Zagreb and to Rijeka via Rijeka Airport in Omi≈°alj on the neighboring island of Krk, until it ceased operations in 2016.
