        The name Lofoten comes from "lo", meaning lynx,and "foten", which means "the foot". The chain of islands with their pointed peaks look like lynx feet from the mainland.1Another name it receives is Lofotveggen,"the wall of the Lofoten". The archipelago looks like a closed wall when viewed from elevated places near Bodo,100 km long, and between 800-1000 m. high.
